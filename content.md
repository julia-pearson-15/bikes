> ### Don’t Be a Jerk  

> DOT’s Don’t Be A Jerk bike safety campaign humorously highlights the essential dos and don’ts of safe, responsible biking. According to DOT’s 2010 Sustainable Streets Index, commuter cycling increased 262% in New York City from 2000 to 2010. With more bikes on the road, smart cycling is even more crucial to making New York City’s streets safer for everyone using them.

#### Safety Tips

These should be prominent on the page - safety is our primary focus!

> ### Safety Tips

> - Ride in a straight line, **obey traffic signs and signals**, and do not weave in and out of traffic. Riding predictably reduces your chances of a crash with a motor vehicle.
> - **Look, signal and look again** before changing lanes or making a turn. Establish eye contact with drivers. Seeing a driver is often not enough. Make sure drivers see you before executing a turn or riding in front of a turning car.
> - **Watch out for car doors.** Be prepared for the possibility that a car door may be opened in your path. When possible, leave room between yourself and parked cars (3 feet is generally recommended) so that you can avoid a door that opens unexpectedly.
> - **Stay visible.** Wear brightly colored clothing for daytime riding. At night, use reflective materials and lights.
> - **Use your bell.** Your bell alerts drivers, pedestrians and other cyclists to your presence, it is required by law.
> - **Don't wear earphones.** By law you may wear one earbud, but keeping your ears clear is a much safer choice.
> - **Wear a helmet.** Helmets are required by law for children age 13 or younger and working cyclists, helmets are a good idea for cyclists of all ages.
